The potentiometer is connected to the input pin, A0. Since the potentiometer initially has values from 0-1023, it is scaled using the map function to only output values from 0-99. The following pins: pin2, pin3, pin4, pin5, pin8, pin9, pin10, pin11, are initialized as output pins in order to provide data to the decoder. If statements are used to convert the values obtained from the potentiometer to binary code (in this case using high or low because I used the digitalWrite function). The decoder is wired to the 7-seg display as it is able to convert binary code to outputs for the 7-segment display by turning on the correct pins on the 7-segment display. For the 7-segment display on the right, the last digit is obtained using number%10 (remainder when divided by 10). When the last digit is obtained, the digitalWrite function is used to make the pins HIGH or LOW allowing the decoder to know what number it needs to tell the 7-segment to display. For the 7-segment display on the left, the first digit is obtained using inervals as it remains the same for 10-digits. For example, the first digit from 10-19 remains 1 and the first digit from 20-29 remains 2. Also, the resistors are used to prevent the the 7-segment display from getting too much current. When the simulation is started, the arduino is powered using the usb connection. Then, when the potentiometer is altered, the 7-segement displays the correct values as it is connected to the decoder which gets input from the output pins. The values from the potentiometer were confirmed by using the Serial.println() function that allowed me to clearly tell which number the potentiometer is outputting. Using that function, I compared whether the 7-segment displays were outputting the same value, which they are.  
The image below shows how the decoder is connected to the output pins: pin2, pin3, pin4, pin5, which are either HIGH or LOW according to the if statements. The resistors are between each connection of the 7-segment display and the decoder. The 7-segement display has specific pins, such as a,b,c,d,e and f, which the decoder has as well. The pin a on the decoder is connected to pin a on the 7-segement, and the same goes for all the other pins.
